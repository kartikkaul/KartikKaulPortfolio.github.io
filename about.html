                <p>As an aspiring Data Analyst/Scientist with an M.S. in Applied Data Science from Syracuse University and a background in Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering, I specialize in extracting business insights using Python, SQL, and R. My professional journey includes impactful roles at DISH Network, iConsult Collaborative, and Accenture. At DISH, I employed AWS and BI tools for predictive modeling, significantly reducing customer churn. At iConsult, my focus was on enhancing data organization and stakeholder engagement through data visualization and SQL database management. While at Accenture, I used SQL for identifying cost-saving measures and Tableau for sales trend analysis. Holding certifications in cloud computing, Lean Six Sigma, and Tableau, I am dedicated to ongoing learning in the field of data science. I'm eager to connect and work on transformative, data-centric projects.</p>
